This repository contains a simple Emacs Lisp package to lookup Scimago
quartiles for mathematics journals with completion. I wrote it because
the Scimago website amazingly does not have any completion! Also, once
I learned I can download the data, I wanted to have it locally for
speed and convenience, but also to avoid looking at adds.

The data needs to be downloaded before using the package, that's what
the ~sjr.bqn~ program is for. There's no good reason to write it in BQN
rather than Emacs Lisp, or any other language for that matter: all you
really need is a way to run shell commands and a CSV parser.
